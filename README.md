# Advent of Code 2023

No new programming languages, no clean code, no scrubbing the debug printf statements, no refactoring.

Having 3 kids < 5 joyfully interrupting me is the challenge of my AoC and I'm loving each hug, "hey dad", finger smudges and googoo-gaga button presses.

Oh and I'll never use regex because then I'll have 2 problems.

Without further ado, chatgpt's rendition of joyful ascii snow:
```
   *    *  *     *  *
*    *     *  *    *  
      *  *     *     
 *       *  *    *  *
*    *        *       
   *     *  *     *  
*    *     *     *   
```
